# Getting Started with VSAC Value Sets

<!--

* Introduction

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
  VSAC hosts a wide range of value sets created for differing purposes. 
  For example a value set may be created that is intended to define a population such as "homeless". 
  An other value set relating to homeless might be a set of codes 
  that could be used to determine a probability of homeless 
  (i.e. a patient that has many of the codes in the value set has a higher probability of being homeless).
  Also, value sets come from a number of different organizations 
  and are created by individuals with differing expertise 
  (e.g. clinical background v. non-clinical contributors). 
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, it is critical to evaluate a value set before selecting it for use. 
  Some of the criteria for this evaluation include
  <ul>
    <li>The purpose of the value set</li>
    <li>The source organization of the value set</li>
    <li>The expertises of the creator(s) of the value set</li>
    <li>The type of the value set (e.g. Grouping, Extensional, Intensional, etc.)</li>
    <li>  
      Before selecting a value set for production use it should be reviewed 
      by both clinicians and informaticists. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  There currently is not a repository of VSAC value sets 
  that have been evaluated for fitness for use in the definition of OHDSI phenotypes. 
</p>

  In our first example, we will find and evaluate a value set for covid vaccinations

## Finding a Value Set (COVID)
### Search
The VSAC web site provides a search tool that can be used 
to find candidates for a value set that can be used to define 
a list of codes that represent covid vaccinations as medication/vaccination codes. 
To search for this list of value sets go to the 
<a href="https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/expansions?pr=all">VSAC Search Page</a>. 
Select the "Search Value Sets" tab. 
Enter "covid vaccination" in the Query text box. 
Select Search. 
This should give a list similar to the one shown below.
